1) Using the value 200,000,000 for the -v parameter, run the program
on with the values of 5, 11, and 17 for the -m parameter.
Be sure that the code was compiled with the optimizations turned on.
Indicate the speedups:

-m     Global Memory     Shared Memory         Constant Memory
5
11
17

2) You should see that for all of these the speedups increase
with the increasing mask size. Why?

3) You should also see that for a larger mask size, the Shared
Memory and Constant Memory provide better performance than the Global
Memory.  Why?

4) You should also see that the use of Shared or
Constant Memory for the convolution mask made little difference.
When would using Constant Memory provide better performance?
